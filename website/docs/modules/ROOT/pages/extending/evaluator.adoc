= Evaluator API Commands

The Mill `Evaluator` API provides programmatic access to Mill's core functionalities, allowing you to resolve, plan, and execute build tasks directly.
This API is essential for extending Mill built-in features through interaction and control of the build process.

== Dependency Mapper

In this example, the `depMapper` task demonstrates how to use the `Evaluator` API to resolve and execute multiple build tasks,
then analyze and report on dependency usage within your source files using both `resolveTasks` and `execute`.

This task:

* Resolves the main and test dependencies, as well as all source files using `resolveTasks`.
* Executes these tasks to gather the actual dependencies values and source file paths with `execute`.
* Scans each source file for import statements that match the resolved dependencies with helper methods.
* Prints a report showing which dependencies are used by which source files, including the specific import statements.
