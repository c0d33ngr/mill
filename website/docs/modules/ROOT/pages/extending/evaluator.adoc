= Evaluator API Commands

== `resolveSegments`

Resolves a sequence of Mill selector strings (such as task or module names) into a list of fully-qualified segment paths matching tasks or modules in the build.

=== Parameters:
- `scriptArgs: Seq[String]` - The list of selector strings to resolve (e.g., `Seq("foo.bar")`).
- `selectMode: SelectMode` - Selection mode. Either `SelectMode.Multi` or `SelectMode.Separated`
- `allowPositionalCommandArgs: Boolean` (default: `false`) - Whether to allow positional command arguments.
- `resolveToModuleTasks: Boolean` (default: `false`) - Whether to resolve to module-level tasks if the selector points to a module.

=== Returns:
- `mill.api.Result[List[Segments]]` - A result wrapping the list of resolved segment paths (`Segments`).

=== Example Usage:

include::partial$example/extending/evaluator/1-resolve-segments.adoc[]


== `resolveTasks`

Resolves a sequence of selector strings into a list of concrete Mill tasks (`Task.Named`) matching those selectors.

=== Parameters:
- `scriptArgs: Seq[String]` - Selector strings to resolve (e.g., `Seq("foo.assembly", "test.run")`)
- `selectMode: SelectMode` - Selection mode. Either `SelectMode.Multi` or `SelectMode.Separated`
- `allowPositionalCommandArgs: Boolean` (default: `false`) - Allow positional command arguments.
- `resolveToModuleTasks: Boolean` (default: `false`) - Resolve to module-level tasks if applicable.

=== Returns
- `mill.api.Result[List[Task.Named[?]]]` - List of resolved named tasks.

=== Example Usage:

include::partial$example/extending/evaluator/2-resolve-tasks.adoc[]


== `plan`

Computes and returns the execution plan (ordered task list) for a set of resolved tasks, without running them.

=== Parameters:
- `tasks: Seq[Task.Named[?]]` - List of tasks to plan.

=== Returns:
- `Plan` - A type with execution plan details (including all transitive tasks and their sorted grouping).

=== Example Usage:

include::partial$example/extending/evaluator/3-plan.adoc[]


== `execute`

Executes a list of tasks and returns the results of their evaluation.

=== Parameters:
- `targets: Seq[Task[T]]` - Tasks to execute.
- `reporter: Int` - It reports executions for targets specified in the `targets` parameter.
- `testReporter: TestReporter` (default: `TestReporter.DummyTestReporter`) - It reports executions for tests
- `logger: Logger` (default: `mill.api.Logger`) - Mill built-in logger to output build messages, task progress, errors and other information during execution.
- `serialCommandExec: Boolean` (default: `false`) - It execute targets one after another rather than in parallel if set to `true`.
- `selectiveExecution: Boolean` (default: `false`) - It enables selective execution mode, where only the tasks affected by recent changes( or their dependencies) are executed.

=== Returns:
- `Evaluator.Result[T]` - Contains results of tasks executed, any watched files, and success/failure info for each task.

=== Example Usage:

include::partial$example/extending/evaluator/4-execute.adoc[]


== `evaluate`

Evaluates tasks given as selector strings, resolving them first.

=== Parameters:
- `scriptArgs: Seq[String]` - List of selector strings for tasks to evaluate.
- `selectMode: SelectMode` - Selection mode. Either `SelectMode.Multi` or `SelectMode.Separated`
- `selectiveExecution: Boolean` (default: `false`) - It enables selective execution mode, where only the tasks affected by recent changes( or their dependencies) are executed.

=== Returns:
- `mill.api.Result[Evaluator.Result[Any]]` - The result of evaluating the tasks (including outputs, watched files, etc).

=== Example Usage:
